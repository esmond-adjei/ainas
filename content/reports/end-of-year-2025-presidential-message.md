# PRESIDENT'S END-OF-YEAR MESSAGE

**Dear Colleagues,**

As the year draws to a close, I want to sincerely thank each of you for the commitment, patience and quiet determination you have shown in your roles at various organisations. This year was **foundational**. We have now completed all statutory and registration processes, deliberately and carefully. We chose to move slowly because we wanted to do things properly, within the law and on firm institutional ground. That foundation now stands.

In parallel, AINAS has been introduced to key organisations in Ghana, across Africa, and internationally. The response has been encouraging. More importantly, we have been watching your individual contributions closely, and we are genuinely pleased with the seriousness, creativity and discipline each of you has brought to your role. AINAS will count on you **greatly** next year.

Next year marks a **shift**.  
We move from positioning to action.  
We will be on the ground.  
We will write stronger proposals, deepen partnerships and sharpen how AINAS is seen and understood.  
Our work will no longer be abstract. It will be **visible, measurable and rooted in real communities**.

<!-- I will reach out to each of you personally to discuss the way forward, roles and expectations.  -->
What we seek to achieve as a society is ambitious but necessary. Our communities need solutions that are **locally designed**, **scientifically sound**, and **socially just**. We are developing innovative models tailored to specific local contexts, and some of these ideas are already taking shape. They will be discussed, refined and implemented in the coming year.

We will also review our constitution, not as a formality, but as a **living framework** that must grow with the organisation. I encourage everyone to be involved in this process. AINAS will only be as strong as the collective thinking, integrity, and ownership we bring into it.

Thank you for believing in this vision. The real work begins now.

Enjoy the season with all its merry cheer!

**Happy holidays!**

Kind regards,  
**[Dr Caleb Melenya Ocansey](/team/caleb-melenya-ocansey)**  
*Founder & President, African Initiative for Nature-Based Solutions (AINAS)*
