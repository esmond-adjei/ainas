**[Dr. Caleb Melenya Ocansey](https://ainas.org/team/caleb-melenya-ocansey)**, AINAS President and Lead for Partnerships at the [DIPPER Lab](https://dipperlab.knust.edu.gh/people/07340ab3-b703-4826-bd23-3ebcdea3f05e), played a central role in convening the maiden European Joint Programme (EJP) **[C-arouNd Project](https://www.embrapa.br/arroz-e-feijao/pesquisa/c-around)** workshop at KNUST. The week-long event brought together scientists and practitioners from **13 institutions across Africa, Europe, South America, and North America** to explore regenerative agriculture, soil health, and climate-smart solutions.

> "Through collaboration and shared knowledge, we can transform how agriculture interacts with our climate," said Dr. Ocansey. "Our goal is to ensure that research doesn't just stay in papers but drives practical change on the ground."

Working closely with **Prof. Vincent Logah** and **Dr. Edward Yeboah**, Dr. Ocansey moderated discussions on improving soil health, increasing soil carbon storage, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The workshop highlighted KNUST’s role as a hub for global collaboration and knowledge exchange on sustainable agriculture.

A key moment was the panel on *“Regenerative Practices on Soil Carbon Storage and Greenhouse Gas Emissions”*, moderated by **[Dr. Caleb Melenya Ocansey](https://ainas.org/team/caleb-melenya-ocansey)** and featuring **[Prof. Eric Tutu Tchao](https://ainas.org/team/eric-tutu-tchao)** and other experts. Participants shared insights on harmonizing research methods, building global databases, and connecting scientific findings to policy and practice.

> "Regenerative agriculture is not just an environmental necessity—it is a path to sustainable livelihoods," highlighted Prof. Tutu Tchao during the discussion.

The workshop concluded with a campus tour, giving participants a chance to engage informally and strengthen collaborative networks. Dr. Ocansey’s leadership highlighted the importance of African-led, globally connected research partnerships in promoting regenerative agriculture and climate resilience.
