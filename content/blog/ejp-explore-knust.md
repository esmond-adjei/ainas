Following the first day of the maiden European Joint Programme (EJP) **C-arouNd Project** workshop, international partners visited the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) campus to explore its rich heritage, research environment, and academic excellence. The tour gave participants from **13 institutions across Africa, Europe, South America, and North America** a firsthand look at the vibrant campus life.

The tour began at the KNUST International Programmes Office (IPO), where visitors were warmly welcomed and delighted by the display of national flags, many eagerly locating their own countries’ flags and capturing photographs to mark the occasion. From there, the group proceeded to the Opoku Ware II Museum, learning about the university’s history and evolution over the years.

Visits to selected colleges and faculties allowed the partners to gain deeper insights into KNUST’s research capacity, academic programs, and campus culture. The experience underscored the university’s role as a hub for collaboration, innovation, and knowledge exchange.

> "Seeing the campus and engaging with KNUST’s vibrant community reinforces the global importance of collaboration in regenerative agriculture," said **[Dr. Caleb Melenya Ocansey](https://ainas.org/team/caleb-melenya-ocansey)**, DIPPER Lab’s Lead for Partnerships.

The workshop, convened by **[Dr. Caleb Melenya Ocansey](https://ainas.org/team/caleb-melenya-ocansey)**, in collaboration with **Prof. Vincent Logah** and **Dr. Edward Yeboah**, continues to foster knowledge sharing and partnerships that advance regenerative agriculture and climate-smart development.
