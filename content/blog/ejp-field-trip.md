# Field Visit to Kintampo Dark Earth Highlights Science and Community Collaboration

During the maiden **EJP C-arouNd Workshop on Regenerative Agriculture, Carbon Storage, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions**, a team of soil scientists and agricultural experts from KNUST and partner institutions visited the **African Dark Earth sites in Kintampo**. The field trip combined research, international collaboration, and hands-on engagement with local communities to better understand these nutrient-rich, carbon-dense soils.

The visit was guided by **Mr. Thomas Adjei-Gyapong**, a pedologist at KNUST, who explained that centuries of organic matter deposition and human activity created these highly fertile soils. Local farmers, he noted, cultivate crops here successfully without relying heavily on chemical fertilizers.

> "Farmers told us that their yields are strong even without mineral fertilizers, thanks to the richness of these soils," said Mr. Adjei-Gyapong.

Participants explored the sites, observed soil profiles, and interacted with local farmers about sustainable practices. Demonstrations included organic matter recycling, climate-smart farming techniques, and discussions on how biochar and modest mineral inputs could further improve productivity. 

> "Sharing knowledge between researchers and farmers is key to making the science behind these soils practical for the community," he added.

**Mr. Emmanuel Baidoo**, a PhD student at KNUST studying the African Dark Earth phenomenon, also shared insights on his research during a podcast moderated by **Dr. Adonis Dakarai Nciizah**, highlighting the ongoing efforts to connect field research with community practices.

The Kintampo field trip followed the workshop at KNUST, which brought together experts from **13 institutions across Africa, Europe, South America, and North America**. Convened by **[Dr. Caleb Melenya Ocansey](https://ainas.org/team/caleb-melenya-ocansey)** in collaboration with **Prof. Vincent Logah** and **Dr. Edward Yeboah**, the workshop emphasizes knowledge exchange, capacity building, and advancing climate-smart, regenerative agriculture practices across regions.
