# CarbonXtras Deploys Real-Time MRV System to Advance Climate-Smart Agriculture

The **CarbonXtras Project** is advancing climate-smart agriculture across Ghana and Africa through the development of a **dynamic, real-time Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system**. The initiative is designed to equip farmers, policymakers, and researchers with reliable data on soil health, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon sequestration to support informed decision-making.

By combining advanced sensor technologies with local farming knowledge, CarbonXtras enables evidence-based adoption of regenerative practices, sustainable land management, and carbon-credit readiness. Ongoing field activities include soil sampling, historic data collection, and social surveys aimed at understanding local farming systems and climate-related challenges.

Fieldwork has commenced in **Tolon (Tamale)** and will extend to **Navrongo, Kintampo, and Kumasi**, generating baseline data on soil quality while supporting near–real-time monitoring of carbon storage and emissions. These efforts are expected to inform interventions that improve crop productivity and strengthen farmer participation in emerging carbon markets.

> “Collecting field-level data allows us to better understand greenhouse gas emissions and support management practices that are truly climate-smart,” noted **Dr. Jagadeesh Yeluripati**, Lead Principal Investigator.

Farmers and extension officers are also being trained to use the **CarbonXtras mobile MRV application (RETINA)**, enabling direct data input from smartphones and enhancing continuous monitoring.

The multi-country collaboration brings together partners from the **James Hutton Institute (UK)**, **CSIR–Crops Research Institute (Ghana)**, **Embrapa (Brazil)**, and **Sonavision (UK)**, with funding from the **Innovate UK Climate-Smart Agriculture Partnership**. The consortium also includes **KNUST (DIPPER Lab and Department of Agroforestry)**, **AINAS**, **MoFA**, **MEST**, **NCA**, and several CSIR institutes, reflecting a broad alliance committed to climate-smart, regenerative agriculture.
