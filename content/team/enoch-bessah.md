Dr. Enoch Bessah is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology ([KNUST](https://knust.edu.gh)), Ghana. His extensive research focuses on the critical intersections of climate change impact, vulnerability & adaptation assessment and modeling, ecosystem services, water resources assessment and modeling, and land use.

Dr. Bessah's academic background is robust, with a PhD in Environmental Management specializing in Hydro-climatology from the [Pan African University](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://pau.africa/) and the [University of Ibadan, Nigeria](https://ui.edu.ng/). He also holds a Master of Technology in Climate Change and Adapted Land Use from the [Federal University of Technology, Minna, Nigeria](https://futminna.edu.ng/), and a BSc in Agricultural Engineering from [KNUST, Ghana](https://www.knust.edu.gh/).

His research delves into the complex interactions between climate, land, soil, crop, biodiversity, and water systems, aiming to understand their effects on livelihoods. To achieve this, he skillfully utilizes GIS and remote sensing tools, alongside in-situ data collection methods including social surveys, for integrated assessments and modeling. This work is pivotal in developing sustainable solutions in agricultural and environmental engineering.

As a DAAD climapAfrica Postdoctoral Fellow, Dr. Bessah conducted impactful research on quantifying and costing flood risk mitigation services provided by landscape-scale green infrastructure in Nigeria and Ghana. This research significantly contributes to the ongoing discussion surrounding payment for ecosystem services as a crucial climate change mitigation and adaptation strategy. He is also an active member of the [Global Land Programme](https://glp.earth/) and a valued contributor to [Future Africa's FAR-LeaF program](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://futureafrica.science/far-leaf/).
