**Dr. Enoch Bessah** is a **Senior Lecturer** in the **Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering** at **Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana**. His research interests encompass **climate change impact, vulnerability & adaptation assessment and modelling; ecosystem services; water resources assessment and modelling; and land use**. 

Dr. Bessah holds a **PhD in Environmental Management** with a specialization in **Hydro-climatology** from **Pan African University & University of Ibadan, Nigeria**, a **Master of Technology in Climate Change and Adapted Land Use** from **Federal University of Technology, Minna, Nigeria**, and a **BSc in Agricultural Engineering** from **KNUST, Ghana**.

Dr. Bessah's research focuses on the interactions between **climate, land, soil, crop, biodiversity, and water systems**, aiming to understand their effects on livelihoods. He employs **GIS and remote sensing tools**, as well as **in-situ data collection methods**, including social surveys, to conduct integrated assessments and modelling. His work contributes to the development of **sustainable solutions in agricultural and environmental engineering**.

As a **DAAD climapAfrica Postdoctoral Fellow**, Dr. Bessah conducted research on **quantifying and costing flood risk mitigation services** provided by landscape-scale green infrastructure in Nigeria and Ghana, contributing to the debate on **payment for ecosystem services** as a climate change mitigation and adaptation measure. He is a **member of the Global Land Programme** and a **contributor to Future Africa's FAR-LeaF program**.

Dr. Bessah has authored numerous publications in reputable journals, focusing on topics such as **hydrological impacts of climate and land use changes**, the effects of **climate model resolutions on rainfall simulations**, and the impact of **crop farmers' decisions on land-use changes**. His research continues to make significant contributions to understanding and addressing climate-related challenges in agricultural and environmental systems.
