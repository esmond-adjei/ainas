After graduating from the **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) Ghana** in 2014, Angela enrolled in the **International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)** postgraduate diploma program in mathematics. While at ICTP Angela applied for and was awarded the **Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future Fellowship** in 2015 to fund her PhD in mathematics studies at the **University of Glasgow, UK**. In June 2019, she graduated from the University of Glasgow with a **PhD in Mathematics**. Angela is currently a **Research Associate** with interest in Quantum Algebra and the **Academic Manager** for the **Girls in Mathematical Sciences Program (GMSP)** at AIMS Ghana. The GMSP nurtures the talents of secondary school girls from Ghana to unlock their potential in the mathematical sciences. A success of the GMSP is that from November 2020 to date, Angela has directly mentored **116 high school girls** from Ghana with about **80% pursuing STEM** at the tertiary level. As a science communicator, she organises **Science Slam Ghana**, a science communication event where researchers present their research to a lay audience in fun and engaging ways.

Angela is the founder of **Femafricmaths**, an initiative that promotes female African mathematicians. She interviews mathsqueens on the Femafricmaths social media pages to inspire young people about the different career options available when you study mathematics. Angela recruits and trains mathsqueens for hands-on mathematics outreach activities for high school students in Ghana. **Science in Tents, National STEAM Day and Y3p3maths** are a few of these in person outreach activities directly impacting about **500 young students** in Ghana. On social media, Femafricmaths has approximately the following followers: *Facebook - 1,700, X/Twitter - 1,300, Instagram - 800 and YouTube - 500*.

In February 2024, Angela was selected by the **Falling Walls Foundation** for the **2024 Female Science Talents Intensive Track Program**. Angela was one of **20 exceptionally talented scientists** selected from 15 countries for the program. This one year mentoring program promotes female leadership in science, business and society.

Angela is an **international award winning science communicator**. In July 2024, Angela was adjudged the **World's Most Interesting Mathematician** after the **Big Internet Math Off** organised by aperiodical.com. From 2021 to date, Angela's science communication expertise has made her a member of the evaluation panel of the **Breakthrough Junior Challenge**, a two minute science communication video for young people under 18 years old with a prize of **$250,000 college scholarship** and a **$100,000 science laboratory** for the highschool of the winner. In December 2022, Angela was invited as a panellist on the theme of unlocking the potential of the youth at the **World Science Forum** hosted in Cape Town, South Africa.
