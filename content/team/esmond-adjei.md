For a role encompassing all technology and IT responsibilities within your organization, the title **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** is most appropriate. A CTO oversees the technological direction of an organization, aligning tech strategies with business goals, managing IT infrastructure, and leading innovation initiatives.&#x20;

If the role is more focused on day-to-day IT operations and infrastructure management, **Director of Information Technology** or **IT Director** would be suitable alternatives. This position typically handles the implementation and maintenance of IT systems, ensuring they meet the organization's needs.&#x20;

Considering your organization's existing structure, where roles like **Director of Technology & Innovation** already exist, assigning the title **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** would provide clear distinction and align with standard industry practices.
