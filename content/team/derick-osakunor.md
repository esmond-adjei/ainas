**Dr Derick Osakunor** has a background in medical diagnostics, global health, infection, and immunity, with a particular focus on **schistosome morbidity and immuno-epidemiology**. He holds a **PhD in Infection and Immunology** from the **University of Edinburgh**, where he worked with the **Parasite Immuno-epidemiology Group** and the **NIHR Global Health Research Unit TIBA** (Tackling Infections to Benefit Africa).

Dr Osakunor leads both basic and translational research with a significant impact on the policy, practice, and control of **neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)**, as well as infectious and non-communicable diseases globally. His research has advanced our understanding of schistosomiasis, informed **national schistosomiasis control programs**, and contributed to **WHO guidelines for verifying schistosomiasis control**. His pioneering work on **paediatric schistosomiasis** has been instrumental in prioritizing and operationalizing treatment for children within **WHO's schistosomiasis elimination guidelines**.

His long-term goal is to **shape health policy and planning** by demonstrating how research findings can be integrated into existing health systems to improve **universal healthcare**.

As part of a multidisciplinary team, Dr Osakunor is currently investigating the factors influencing disease epidemiology and quantifying the burden and impact of disease on overall health and quality of life. This work aims to develop **locally informed, behaviourally consistent guidelines** for designing and implementing complex disease interventions. Additionally, the project seeks to reduce disease transmission and establish a novel research framework for **water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)-associated diseases**.
