**Dr. Andrew Selasi Agbemenu** is a distinguished **Senior Lecturer** in the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://webapps.knust.edu.gh/staff/dirsearch/profile/summary/9842e5c2345f.html) at the [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Agbemenu) in Kumasi, Ghana. He is also a qualified professional engineer. His academic journey at KNUST includes earning his **BSc in Electrical/Electronic Engineering**, **MSc in Telecommunication Engineering**, and **PhD in Computer Engineering**.

Beyond his lecturing duties, Dr. Agbemenu plays a significant leadership role as the **Deputy Director** of the [Distributed IoT-Platforms, Privacy, and Edge-Intelligence Research (DIPPER) Lab](https://dipperlab.knust.edu.gh/). He is also the lead of the **TI Microelectronics Lab** at KNUST and serves as a **Project Engineer** for the [Responsible AI Lab (RAIL, KNUST)](https://rail.knust.edu.gh/). His expertise has been further honed through a visiting scholar position at the Analog and Mixed Signal Center of the [Texas A&M University (TAMU)](https://dipperlab.knust.edu.gh/labmembers/details/6518166e-d50a-4f68-b897-854a43dfb214), Texas.

Dr. Agbemenu's research interests are diverse and cutting-edge, focusing on **analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits** including work on data converters and using AI for analog design, **sensor design**, **blockchain** with a strong emphasis on optimizing peer-to-peer topology for blockchain-based industrial IoT networks, improving storage efficiency in blockchain systems, and blockchain interoperability, **Internet of Things (IoT)** applied in various contexts including industrial IoT and traceability systems, and **artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning** utilized for a wide range of applications including AI analog design, learned indexing for blockchain systems, and AI applications in agriculture. His publications include "Optimising peer-to-peer topology for blockchain-based industrial internet of things networks using particle swarm optimisation" and "Blockchain interoperability: the state of heterogenous blockchain-to-blockchain communication." He is also involved in the broader conversation around "A new research agenda for African generative AI."

These research domains are integrated to develop innovative solutions across critical developmental value chains, particularly in **agriculture** and **healthcare**. His work in agriculture includes assessing blockchain and IoT for food supply chains in Africa and optimizing peer-to-peer topology for blockchain-based industrial IoT networks for agriculture. In healthcare, his research contributes to areas such as remote patient monitoring and managing long-term health conditions, with [DIPPER Lab's recent work on a novel antenna](https://www.myjoyonline.com/knusts-dipper-lab-unveils-novel-antenna-for-smarter-farming-and-healthcare/) aiming to improve wireless communication for smart farming and healthcare.

Before his academic role at KNUST, which began in 2012, Dr. Agbemenu worked as a **System Programmer** with the **University Information Technology Services**. There, he was responsible for setting up and deploying core open-source technologies for user and email management, as well as configuring and deploying switching, routing, and security solutions. He is an active member of professional societies, including the [IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (IEEE-CASS)](https://dipperlab.knust.edu.gh/labmembers/details/6518166e-d50a-4f68-b897-854a43dfb214) and the [IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (IEEE-SSCS)](https://dipperlab.knust.edu.gh/labmembers/details/6518166e-d50a-4f68-b897-854a43dfb214).

Dr. Agbemenu teaches various courses at KNUST, including **VLSI, Fault Diagnosis and Failure Tolerance, Linear Electronic Circuits, Semiconductor Devices, and Basic Electronics**. His work exemplifies a commitment to advancing technology for societal benefit, particularly in the African context.
